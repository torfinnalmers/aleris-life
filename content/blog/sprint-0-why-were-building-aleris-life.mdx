## The problem

People get lost navigating Aleris services across countries. Different referral processes, insurance types, booking systems. Result: confusion, missed appointments, unnecessary contacts.

## What we're building

A conversational assistant that helps people understand their options and connects them to the right contact - without giving medical advice.

Basic flow: What do you need? → When? → Confirm understanding → Here's who to contact.

## Where we are

Connected to live content from aleris.se/no/dk via Optimizely. Working demo: [aleris-life.vercel.app](https://aleris-life.vercel.app)

## What we'll learn (12 weeks)

- Can we aggregate cross-border content meaningfully?
- Where are content gaps?
- What capabilities do we need to scale this?
- Is there real user value here?

## How we work

Bi-weekly updates sharing: what we wanted to learn, what we tried, what we built, what we actually learned, what's next.

Working software is our truth.

## Next: Sprint 1 (ending 12 Feb)

Testing broader queries, expanding content types, demo to all countries.
